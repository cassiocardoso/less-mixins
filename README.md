# LESS Mixins

This repository holds all [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) mixins I've been using in my recent projects.

This is not intent to be like [LESS Elements](http://lesselements.com/) or [LESS Hat](http://lesshat.madebysource.com/), which are great mixins libraries for LESS. It's just some useful mixins I think it's worth sharing.

Feel free to download and use it. And if you really enjoy the project, contribute.

## Available via Bower

You can download the mixins through [Bower](http://bower.io):

	bower install useful-less-mixins

## Structure

The `mixins.less` file in root is the main file which agregates all mixins.

Every mixin has it's own file inside `/mixins` folder. So it's easy to add/remove or edit each of them.
